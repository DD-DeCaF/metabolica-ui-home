<p>Welcome to our cell factory design and analysis platform! We develop the platform as part of the <a href="http://dd-decaf.eu">DD-DeCaF</a> project with the goal to put model-guided and data-driven design into practice in industrial biotechnology. The platform will enable the following key technologies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Metagenomics-enabled design of novel enzymes and biochemical pathways.</li>
<li>Omics data-driven design of cell factories for the production of chemicals and proteins.</li>
<li>Analysis and design of microbial communities relevant to human health, industrial biotechnology and agriculture.</li>
</ul>
<p>With this interactive web application, we target primarily non-expert users that have a need to analyze omics data and compute strains designs. An advance programming interface is provided for expert users (<a href="https://docs.dd-decaf.eu/">API docs</a>) enabling them deviate from the default workflows and perform custom analyses.</p>
<p>The platform is currently in <strong>beta</strong> and tested primarily with Google Chrome. If you&#39;d like to stay up-to-date with new releases, please <a href="https://tinyletter.com/dd-decaf">subscribe</a> to our quarterly newsletter. We will be eternally grateful for feedback in case you miss features or you encountered a problem (for now please drop us a message at <a href="mailto:niso@biosustain.dtu.dk">niso@biosustain.dtu.dk</a>).</p>
<p>The following sections provide an overview of what you can currently do on platform. Have fun!</p>
<h3 id="login-optional-">Login (optional)</h3>
<p>You can log in <a href="https://app.dd-decaf.eu/login">here</a> or by navigating to
the menu in the upper right-hand corner. We support sign-on through a number of social media platforms. Alternatively, you can <a href="mailto:niso@biosustain.dtu.dk">contact</a> us for an account.</p>
<p><img src="../../gifs/login.gif" alt="Login screencast" width="650"></p>
<p>Logging in is optional, (you can browse public domain data and run
simulations) but necessary for uploading your own data.</p>
<h3 id="interactive-cell-factory-design-and-omics-data-integration">Interactive cell factory design and omics data integration</h3>
<p>In the <a href="https://app.dd-decaf.eu/app/pathwayvis">Interactive Map</a> we utilize metabolic pathway maps as an intuitive user interface for model simulation and data analysis, giving biologists the ability to modify models in a visual way instead of writing programming code. For example, reactions can be deleted from the host organism.</p>
<p><img src="../../gifs/knockout.gif" alt="Reaction knockout" width="650"></p>
<p>All modifications can be undone (for example the reaction deletion).</p>
<p><img src="../../gifs/undo-knockout.gif" alt="Reaction knockout" width="650"></p>
<p>The side panel on the left provides the user with additional information (for example the medium composition) and the ability to select different model simulation methods. The default simulation method, <a href="http://cobramethods.wikidot.com/pfba">pFBA</a> (<em>parsimonious flux balance analysis</em>), will compute a flux distribution that maximizes growth yield and minimizes the cost of enzyme expression simultaneously. Descriptions of the other available methods will follow shortly.</p>
<p><img src="../../gifs/side-panel-medium-simulation-methods.gif" alt="Reaction knockout" width="650"></p>
<p>Computationally more extensive methods can be chosen to get uncertainty estimates for the predicted fluxes. For example, pFBA-FVA combines <a href="http://cobramethods.wikidot.com/pfba">pFBA</a> with <a href="http://cobramethods.wikidot.com/flux-variability-analysis">FVA</a> (<em>flux variability analysis</em>). Uncertain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flux_(metabolism">metabolic fluxes</a>) are highlighted using transparency.</p>
<p><img src="../../gifs/pfba-fva.gif" alt="Reaction knockout" width="650"></p>
<p>In addition to central carbon metabolism, the side panel provides an extended selection of pathway maps the user can explore. For example amino acid biosynthesis:</p>
<p><img src="../../gifs/amino-acids-pathway.gif" alt="Select amino acid biosynthesis map" width="650"></p>
<p>You can search the map by pressing Control-F (Command-F on Mac). <em>The arrow buttons for cycling through the matches are currently not visible. This will be fixed soon.</em></p>
<p><img src="../../gifs/searching-on-pathway.gif" alt="Select amino acid biosynthesis map" width="650"></p>
<p>Furthermore, heterologous reactions can be added on the fly which in combination with reaction deletions (see above) facilitates manual strain design.</p>
<p><img src="../../gifs/add-reaction.gif" alt="Add pyruvate carboxylase" width="650"></p>
<p>The application furthermore allows the user to analyze and integrate data with models (see below for how to upload data to the platform) and utilize animation to compare different data sets. </p>
<p><img src="../../gifs/data-driven-card-animation.gif" alt="Data-driven simulation plus animation" width="650"></p>
<h3 id="computational-cell-factory-design">Computational cell factory design</h3>
<p>In the <a href="https://app.dd-decaf.eu/app/pathways">Pathways</a> application you can predict metabolic routes to products that your host can not natively produce and share with the <a href="https://app.dd-decaf.eu/app/pathwayvis">Interactive Map</a> application for further inspection.</p>
<p><img src="../../gifs/pathways.gif" alt="Predicting heterologous pathways screencast" width="650"></p>
<p>In the near future, we will transform this application into a full-fledged computational strain design tool enabling the identification of gene deletion and expression modulation strategies (in addition to the pathway predictions).</p>
<h3 id="assessing-the-capabilities-of-cell-factories">Assessing the capabilities of cell factories</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://app.dd-decaf.eu/app/yields">Theoretical Yield</a> application enables you to evaluate your strain performance in the context of the theoretical production and growth limits.</p>
<p><img src="../../gifs/theoretical-yield-app.gif" alt="Theoretical yield app" width="650"></p>
<h3 id="uploading-data">Uploading data</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://app.dd-decaf.eu/app/upload">Upload data</a> application will appear in the left panel after you log in. It supports a number of different data types and experimental meta data.</p>
<p><img src="../../gifs/upload-data.gif" alt="Uploading data" width="650"></p>
<p>If you&#39;re not comfortable uploading proprietary data, please get in touch with us (<a href="mailto:niso@biosustain.dtu.dk">niso@biosustain.dtu.dk</a>) as our platform can easily be deployed to your own infrastructure.</p>
